            MCFB engages elected officials on behalf of local farmers through in-person meetings, testimonies, letters, and phone calls. 
            MCFB may host meetings specifically to engage elected officials, may invite elected officials to a previously scheduled MCFB 
            meeting, and may attend town halls and other meetings hosted by elected officials. When possible, MCFB will inform MCFB members 
            about its engagement with elected officials through email, mailers, and the MCFB Facebook page.
