            MCFB sponsors and hosts workshops to help local farmers achieve necessary certifications and licenses and remain compliant with 
            laws and regulations. We are developing an annual “curriculum” that farmers can depend on every year. The curriculum will include 
            two workshop topics that are the same from year to year and two workshop topics that change from year to year. Our current workshop 
            training schedule is below. Workshops will be announced through email, mailers, and the MCFB Facebook site.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>January/February:</strong> Worker Protection Standards & Pesticides for Owners/Managers</li>
