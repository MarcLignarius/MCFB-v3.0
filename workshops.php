    <p>MCFB sponsors and hosts workshops to help local farmers achieve necessary certifications and licenses and remain compliant with laws and regulations. We are developing an annual “curriculum” that farmers can depend on every year. The curriculum will include two workshop topics that are the same from year to year and two workshop topics that change from year to year. Our current workshop training schedule is below. Workshops will be announced through email, mailers, and the MCFB Facebook site.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>January/February:</strong> Worker Protection Standards & Pesticides for Owners/Managers</li>
        <li><strong>April/May:</strong> Worker Protection Standards & Pesticides for Workers and Handlers</li>
        <li><strong>September/October:</strong> Rotating training topic</li>
        <li><strong>November/December:</strong> Rotating training topic</li>
    </ul>
