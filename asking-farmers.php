        People have questions about farming. Whether members of the general public, students, industry representatives, government employees, or elected officials, when farm-related questions come up, people tend to turn to the usual information sources. These information sources often consist of friends, colleagues, books, the Internet, or academic experts. Rarely, though, do people have ready access to real farmers. Real farmers have unique experiences, knowledge, and understanding of land and farming techniques and issues. Farmers, local communities, and our society in general will benefit if people who are seeking to understand farming better have the ability to ask farmers directliy. Given this, MCFB wants to connect people with questions about farming with real farmers. To accomplish this, we will establish the “Ask a Farmer” program.
