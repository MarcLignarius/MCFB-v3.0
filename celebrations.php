        MCFB hosts one major celebration - the end of year holiday party - each year in December. Notices of the date, time, and place of the annual holiday party are sent to Voting and Supporting members through newsletters and mailers. A notice is also posted on the MCFB Facebook Page. Other celebrations may be scheduled and noticed on a periodic basis.
