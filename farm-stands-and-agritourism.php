        Farm stands and agritourism are a growing part of many successful farm businesses. OFB publishes <a href="https://oregonfb.org/oregonsbounty/">Oregon's Bounty Farm Stand Guide</a> each year. The guide provides easy access to OFB member farm stands and beyond. In addition, MCFB promotes local farm stands every year on this website and social media to assist local farmers in getting the word out to our communities about their offerings.
