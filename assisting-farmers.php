        Farmers are resourceful and creative people, but sometimes they would like assistance solving problems or addressing issues on their land. While there are many local, state, and federal entities that assist farmers in a variety of ways, many farmers would prefer to engage with a local farm group, such as MCFB, to help them solve problems. Given this, MCFB undertakes projects and activities to assist local farmers and communities.

        Recent efforts to assist our farmers and local communities include:

        <li>Research into the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services Water Submeter Program.</li>
        <li>Advice regarding farm equipment export for developing countries.</li>
    </ul>
