            MCFB's Board of Directors must include a President and Secretary as Board Officers, and no less than one additional Board 
            Director. The Board of Directors may choose to elect a Vice-President and Treasurer as additional Board Officers, and up to 
            eight additional Board Directors. In addition, if there is a county Women's Committee and/or a Young Farmers and Ranchers 
            Committee, the Chair of each committee shall be a voting member of the Board of Directors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Board Officers are elected by Voting Members each year at the Annual MCFB Meeting (see <a href="board-meetings.php">Board Meetings</a>). 
            Other Board Directors, also elected at the Annual MCFB Meeting, serve staggered terms of two years. Only full MCFB Voting Members 
            can serve on the Board of Directors. In addition to the Annual MCFB Meeting, the Board of Directors normally meets seven times 
            throughout each year (see <a href="board-meetings.php">Board Meetings</a>).

                <h4>Al Garre - Board Director</h4>
                <p> Al’s grandfather started the family farm in northeast Portland in 1920. Al took over the
                    operation in 1984. The family farm has always grown fresh market vegetables. Since Al
                    entered semi-retirement in 2018, the farm has produced a small amount of herbs. Al
                    became an MCFB member when he took over the farm in 1984. It was around that same
                    time that he joined the MCFB Board. His current term as a Board Director expires in
                    2020. Al has always tried to actively support OFB and MCFB but feels he has gotten
                    more out of the organization than he has given to it. It is Al’s firm belief that OFB and
                    MCFB do more for family farms than any other group. Al received his Bachelor of
                    Science in Mechanical Engineering in 1971 from Oregon State University.

                <h4>Joe Rossi - Board Director</h4>
                <p>Joe is a fourth-generation farmer in northeast Portland and currently farms alongside his daughter, Gabrielle Rossi. Joe and Gabrielle’s farm has always produced row crop fresh vegetables for sale and distribution in the Portland Metro area. As an urban farm, the location also avails itself to event space and farm tours. As a result, the farm is active in the community and the local Parkrose School District activities (the middle school and high school are built on two sections of the historic farm). Community and school engagement are traditions that Joe’s dad started and one that he continues today with Gabrielle. Being in an urban environment, the farm serves as a window into agriculture for our state. Joe and his family have been Multnomah County Farm Bureau members for more than 50 years. Joe became more involved when he joined the MCFB Board of Directors in 2018. Joe graduated from Parkrose High School and studied business at Portland State University before becoming a fulltime farmer.</p>
